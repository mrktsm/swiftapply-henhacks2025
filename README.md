## Inspiration 
As computer science students, we struggled to balance coursework, projects, and the overwhelming task of applying to internships and jobs. The repetitive nature of filling out applications, tweaking resumes, and crafting cover letters took valuable time away from learning and growing our skills. We envisioned an AI-powered assistant that could streamline the application process, allowing students to focus on what truly matters—building their careers.

## What it does
SwiftApply automates job applications with AI-driven efficiency. Users log in, upload their resumes, and answer a few questions about their preferences. Our AI agents analyze their profiles and apply to jobs that best match their skills and experience. SwiftApply also provides users with insights on how to improve their applications, offering feedback reports to enhance their chances of success. In the future, we aim to track application statuses and assist users in follow-ups.

## How we built it
We developed SwiftApply as a web platform using:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Shadcn UI, Tailwind for an intuitive user experience.
- **Backend**:  Spring, Fast API user data transfer and integration.
- **AI Agent Integration**: browser-use for agentic browser manipulation, Gemini's Ai web-browsing Agent, OpenAI's GPT models for resume analysis, job compatibility assessment, and application automation.
- **Database**: MySQL for storing user profiles and application history.

## Challenges we ran into
- Ensuring AI accurately matches users with relevant jobs while filtering out unsuitable ones.
- Automating applications across different job portals with varying formats.
- Balancing application volume with quality—optimizing for meaningful job submissions rather than spam.
- Speed and efficiency: AI agents needed fine-tuning to optimize response times and minimize delays.
- browser agent and web app integration: Integrating a web application with browser agent scripts by engineering an automated and robust workflow from sign-up to execution and data storage in the backend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully automating one-click job applications with AI.
- Providing actionable insights to improve user applications.
- Developing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the job search.
- Laying the groundwork for AI-assisted follow-ups and long-term career tracking.

## What we learned
- The importance of refining AI-driven job-matching for better results.
- Optimizing AI agent performance across different job portals is crucial for scalability.
- Users appreciate a balance between automation and control, preferring some customization in how applications are sent.

## What's next for SwiftApply
- **AI Agent Optimization**: Fine-tune AI models for faster and more efficient job applications.
- **Follow-Up Tracking**: Implement AI-driven email parsing to track application statuses and suggest next steps.
- **Expanded Job Site Integration**: Improve compatibility with more job boards and career platforms.
- **Smart Recommendations**: Enhance feedback reports to include personalized resume improvements and skill-building suggestions.

SwiftApply aims to revolutionize job applications, making career-building effortless and intelligent!
